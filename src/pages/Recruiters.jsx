            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>Do my candidates need to pay?</h3>
              <p>Yes—candidates pay a one-time $29-49 fee to create their video profile. However, with our Premium plan (Q2 2026), you can choose to sponsor candidates' profiles as a value-add service.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>Can I review videos before candidates share them with clients?</h3>
              <p>Yes (with Premium plan). You can review and provide feedback before candidates send videos to hiring managers.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>What if my clients don't want to watch videos?</h3>
              <p>Then they don't watch. But in our experience, hiring managers WILL watch a 30-second video if it saves them from scheduling 30-minute phone screens. And candidates who use video get noticed more.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>Can I white-label this with my firm's branding?</h3>
              <p>Yes (with Premium plan, launching Q2 2026). Get early access and discounted pricing as a founding member.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>How do I get my candidates to use this?</h3>
              <p>Simple: "Hey [Candidate Name], I want to make sure you stand out. I'm sending you a link to create a 30-second video profile. It takes 10 minutes and will make a huge difference in how hiring managers see you."</p>

            <div className="faq-item">

              <p>Save 4+ hours per role on phone screens. Win 40% more placements by differentiating candidates. Close roles 40% faster when clients can immediately see who to interview.</p>
